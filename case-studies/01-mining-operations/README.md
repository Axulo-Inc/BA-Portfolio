# 🔥 Mining Operations Optimization Dashboard

## Executive Summary
Developed a real-time dashboard for mining operations that reduced downtime by 12% and improved compliance by 8%.

## Problem Statement
Manual reporting systems caused delayed decision-making (24-48 hour delays) and operational inefficiencies. Equipment failures were addressed reactively rather than predictively, and compliance tracking was manual and error-prone.

## Solution
- **Real-time dashboard** with Power BI and Streamlit visualization
- **Automated ETL pipeline** integrating IoT sensors, ERP, and maintenance systems
- **Predictive analytics** for equipment maintenance scheduling
- **Centralized data warehouse** with comprehensive database design

## Results
⏱️ **12% reduction** in operational downtime  
📏 **8% improvement** in stope width compliance  
💰 **Estimated $2M annual savings** through efficiency gains  
📊 **22 KPIs tracked** in real-time for data-driven decision making

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, SQLite, ETL pipeline)
- **Power BI** for executive dashboards
- **SQLite/PostgreSQL** for data storage
- **Streamlit** for operational dashboards

## Detailed Artifacts
✅ **Business Requirements Document** - Defines project scope and success criteria  
✅ **Data Dictionary** - Documents all data sources and business rules  
✅ **ETL Pipeline Code** - Automated data processing and quality checks  
✅ **Database Schema** - Complete database design with relationships
